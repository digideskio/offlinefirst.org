  <h2>
    We're taking the Offline First community for a four day weekend on the central coast of California.
  </h2>
  <p>We’re developers interested in making our apps work without constant internet connection. We’re designers exploring UX patterns that maintain user understanding of system state. We are all working on problems that very few have worked on before us, and we know it will take a wide range of points of view to solve the big challenges ahead of us. </p>
  <p>Join us for an exciting three days away from it all with the Offline First community!</p>

    <p>Located in Santa Margarita, California, the camp will mostly take place inside one large house. There will be enough room to roam, relax, find solitude, and, of course, to collaborate.</p>
